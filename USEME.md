## 1. Fetching & Passing
In the root directory of the project, ensure there is a folder named images, which should contain the following two subdirectories:

    input/: This directory holds the input images that the program processes.
    output/: This directory stores the output images generated by the program.

Make sure to place and check the appropriate images in their respective directories before running the project.

## 2. Compilation Instructions

To compile the Java files, ensure that you are inside the `src` directory of the project. Depending on your operating system and shell, use one of the following commands:

- **PowerShell**:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { javac -d ../res $_.FullName }

- **Command Prompt (CMD)**:
  ```
  for /r %i in (*.java) do javac -d ..\res "%i"

- **Git Bash / Linux**:
  ```
  find . -name "*.java" -exec javac -d ../res {} \;

- **macOS (Option 1):**:
  ```
  find . -name "*.java | xargs javac -d ../res

- **macOS (Option 1):**:
  ```
  for file in $(find . -name "*.java"); do javac -d ../res "$file"; done

Each of these commands will recursively find all Java files in the src directory and compile them into the res directory.

## 3. Running the Program

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute one of the following commands:


**Option 1: Without Command Line Arguments**

- If you do not need to pass any command line arguments, use:

   ```
   java -cp res Main

**Option 2: With Command Line Arguments**

- If you need to pass command line arguments, replace `filename` with your desired argument and use::

   ```
   java -cp res Main fileName

- The given file should be in the root directory of the project.


## Script Commands
As all input images are inside /images/input, user needs to give "/input/fileName" to load images.

As all output images are inside /images/output, user needs to give "/output/fileName" to save image.

This is the done to improvise clarity while loading, manipulation, enhancement and saving of multiple images, avoid confusion and keep images segregated.

Below are some sample examples on how commands should be written in script file to get desired output:
- Load an image and name it\
  `load input/sample.ppm sample`<br/><br/>

- Save a loaded image named "sample"\
  `save input/sample.ppm sample`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image with just the red component\
  `red-component sample sample-red`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image with just the green component\
  `green-component sample sample-green`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image with just the blue component\
  `blue-component sample sample-blue`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image using the value component\
  `value-component sample sample-value`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image using the intensity component\
  `intensity-component sample sample-intensity`<br/><br/>

- Create a new image using the luma component\
  `luma-component sample sample-luma`<br/><br/>

- Split the image into RGB components\
  `rgb-split sample sample-red sample-green sample-blue`<br/><br/>

- Combine 3 different red, green, and blue component images into a single image\
  `rgb-combine sample-new sample-red sample-green sample-blue`<br/><br/>

- Brighten the image by adding a constant (here, 25)\
  `brighten 25 sample sample-brighter`<br/><br/>

- Darken the image by adding a negative constant (here, -25)\
  `brighten -25 sample sample-brighter`<br/><br/>

- Flip the image horizontally\
  `horizontal-flip sample sample-horizontal`<br/><br/>

- Flip the image vertically\
  `vertical-flip sample sample-vertical`<br/><br/>

- Add sepia transform to the image\
  `sepia sample sample-sepia`<br/><br/>

- Add blur filter to the image\
  `blur sample sample-blur`<br/><br/>

- Add sharpen filter to the image\
  `sharpen sample sample-greyscale`<br/><br/>

- Overwrite the image with another file\
  `load input/sample.ppm sample`<br/><br/>

- Run a script file\
  `run sampleScript.txt`<br/><br/>

- Compress an image by a given percentage (here, 25%)\
  `compress 25 image-name dest-image-name`<br/><br/>

- Create an image which is a histogram of the image\
  `histogram image-name dest-image-name`<br/><br/>

- Adjust color balance based on histogram peaks.\
  `color-correct image-name dest-image-name`<br/><br/>

- Enhance contrast using black (b), midtone (m), and white (w) points.\
  `levels-adjust b m w image-name dest-image-name`<br/><br/>

- Generate a split view, applying transformations to a specified portion of the image.\
  `operation image-name dest-image split p` (operation can be blur, sharpen, sepia, greyscale, color-correct or levels-adjust)
